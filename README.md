## PROBLEM DEFINITION

  Charities always need more volunteers, particularly during variable event seasons. (Yearly fundraisers etc.) Not for profit's in Australia source 6.1 million volunteers each year. These volunteers work for a combined 713 million hours each year. This is an average of 100 hours per person per year. (Although it is worth noting the unreliability of self-reported data.) Source: https://www.volunteeringaustralia.org/wp-content/uploads/VA-Key-statistics-about-Australian-volunteering-16-April-20151.pdf

  To see how the general public felt about volunteering I created a short survey to ask people's experiences and their barriers to volunteering. Whilst a large amount of people (50%+) already volunteer, many feel as though they don't volunteer enough with a whopping 100% of people feeling they do not volunteer enough. A survey I created found the number one reason people were unlikely to volunteer is time constraints with 76% of respondents.

## PROBLEM SOLUTION

  A platform to 'Crowd-Source' volunteers. Allow users to find volunteer opportunities based on availabilities and skills. Allow charities to post up advertisements and manage volunteers. Focus on short, variable opportunities.
