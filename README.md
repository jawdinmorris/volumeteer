## PROBLEM Definition

  People wish to volunteer more often. However it's hard to find the right fit in regards to commitment and skills.

  Charities struggle to find more volunteers than regulars and thus avoid variables.


## PROBLEM SOLUTION

  A platform to 'Crowd-Source' volunteers. Allow users to find volunteer opportunities based on availabilities. Allow charities to post up advertisements and manage volunteers.
